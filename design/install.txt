Installation Requirements and Tips
==================================

1) PHP
2) MySQL
3) init_db.sql
4) User and file permissions
	The linux user used for development should belong to the group 'www-data'.
	This is because apache runs as this user. Also, all the directories in
	the DOCUMENT_ROOT should have the group changed to www-data. This is
	because the upload_resume.php will try to create the
	DOCUMENT_ROOT/uploads directory during the 1st upload, and you dont
	want it to fail.
