Krypton Design Notes
--------------------

It has been unanimously decided by the only member of the project (which
is me) to use jqueryui, or at least a part of it. The background png's
used by jqueryui are to be definitely omitted.

Jquery based components, some of which are unfortunately not part
of jqueryui despite being popular, needs to be written from scratch.
	o Carousel
		Needs no explanation. This popular component on which most
		landing pages depend is not part of jqueryui and hence needs to
		be written. There are 100's of free ones out there, but writing
		it natively will keep it small (and it will be fun).
	o Live Filter
		When an element is registered as a live filter, it should
		provide a timeout and a callback. The callback will be called
		'timeout' seconds _after_ the element's value changes. The
		element which is registered _should_ support the jquery .val()
		function.
	o Slider
		jQueryui already provides this and Im tempted to use it.
		But yet to check if the slider can be defined on a textbox,
		because the slider will ultimately be a live filter, which
		needs the element to support a .val() function.

Threads
-------
The Krypton application would eventually require using some threads
(for maybe event polling). It is still not clear if a dedicated
js function should be called using setInterval(), or if jQuery's
.queue() can be used in some way.

Pages
-----
Pages are div's with class 'page'. A page is whatever is below the
navigation area, and at a time only one page is displayed. The rest
are hidden. Some pages could also have class 'overlay', which means
it is displayed on top of the current page (with z-index 2), and
on closing or clicking back button will hide and reveal the underlying
page.

TODO
----
1) Decide database schema and create a install.sql
